# Barycenters on Stiefel and Grassmann manifolds

This repository contains Python code corresponding to the paper entitled ``Beyond R-barycenters: a more efficient averaging method on Stiefel and Grassmann'' by F. Bouchard, N. Laurent, S. Said and N. Le Bihan.

It contains code that allows to:
* Simulate random centers and samples on Stiefel and Grassmann manifolds.
* Compute R-barycenters on Stiefel associated with the polar, QR and orthographic retractions.
* Compute the Riemannian Fr√©chet mean on Grassmann.
* Compute the proposed projected arithmetic means on Stiefel and Grassmann manifolds.
